# FractalRust

A fractal renderer written in Rust, since I like fractals

## Early timeline

- Started on December 15, 2020
- No useful results except a black-and-white Mandelbrot set on February 24, 2021, during senior year of high school
- Multithreaded by July 5, 2021
- Added Dragon Curve and Levy C Curve on July 18, 2021
- Uploaded to Git on September 25, 2021 so that there are finally timestamps in when I add features

## Purpose

Learn Rust, of course! With its extremely safe practices and aggressive optimizations, it matches the speed of [JuliaRender](https://github.com/Noorquacker/JuliaRender), my other C/C++ fractal renderer that this project was originally going to be a rewrite of.
